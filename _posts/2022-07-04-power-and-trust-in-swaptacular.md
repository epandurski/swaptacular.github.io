  Ultimately, money is mainly an instrument of power. When the power
  is evil, money should be evil too. When the power is good, money
  should also be good, right?

## Power is not good or bad per say

"One man's meat is another man's poison", they say. It may not always
be obvious, but in every society there are many powers at play. They
compete with each other, and they ally with each other. The competing
powers are almost certainly perceived as bad. The allied powers are
more likely to be perceived as good.

This process can not be stopped. The only thing which is *partly, but
not entirely* in our control is how we choose our allies. Normally, we
chose as allies people who we trust. But from time to time, reality
asserts itself, and we are forced to trust people who normally we
would not trust.

Paul is an owner of a restaurant. The business is good, and people
like Paul's restaurant.
