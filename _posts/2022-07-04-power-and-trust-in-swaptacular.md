  Ultimately, money is mainly an instrument of power. When the power
  is evil, money should be evil too. When the power is good, money
  should also be good, right?

## Power is not good or bad per say

"One man's meat is another man's poison", they say. It may not always
be obvious, but in every society there are many powers at play. They
compete with each other, and they ally with each other. Competing
powers are almost certainly perceived as bad. Allied powers are more
likely to be perceived as good.

This process can not be stopped. The only thing which is *partly, but
not entirely* in our control is how we choose our allies. Normally, we
chose as allies people who we trust. But from time to time, reality
asserts itself, and we are forced to trust people who normally we
would not trust.

Imagine this: Paul is an owner of a restaurant. The business is good.
Many people love Paul's restaurant. Unfortunately, the old, but very
expensive ventilation system stopped working, and has to be
replaced. Paul applies for a bank load. They make him sign a bunch of
documents with lots of fine-print. Paul has no choice but to trust
them. From now on, Paul and the bank are allies.

Sounds familiar?

You see, Paul is not a nobody. He is *powerful* and very well
respected man in his neighborhood. Hundreds of people dine at his
restaurant every day. And yet, a broken ventilation system forces him
to make dubious friends. Pity!

decentralized by its nature, and consists of five different types of
actors:
