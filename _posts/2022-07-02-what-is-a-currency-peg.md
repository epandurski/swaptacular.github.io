## Well, yes, and no!

Here is where currency pegging comes in:

> Currency pegging is when a country attaches, or pegs, its exchange
> rate to another currency, or basket of currencies, or another
> measure of value, such as gold. Pegging is sometimes referred to as

Often, governments of smaller countries peg their currencies to the
currency of a bigger country. But this "pegging business" does not
stop here!

When a new commercial bank starts to operate, in reality, a brand new
digital currency is being created. When the bank approves a loan,
fresh new tokens of the bank's digital currency are being issued in
circulation. With tens of thousands of commercial banks operating, how
come this does not turn into a complete mess?

You probably know the answer to this question already: Every
commercial bank pegs its digital currency to the currency issued by
the central bank of the country. The currency issued by the central
bank is called *bank reserves*.

> Bank reserves are the cash minimums that financial institutions must
> have on hand in order to meet central bank requirements. This is
> real paper money that must be kept by the bank in a vault on-site or
> held in its account at the central bank. Cash reserves requirements
> are intended to ensure that every bank can meet any large and
> unexpected demand for withdrawals.

When somebody transfers money from one commercial bank to another, in
reality, several "invisible" exchanges happen:

1. The sender's bank "sells" some amount of its *bank reserves* to the
   central bank.

2. The central bank increases the *bank reserves* held by the
   recipient's bank, and instructs the bank to "wire" the same amount
   of recipient's bank digital currency to the recipient's account.

3. If the *bank reserves* held by the sender's bank fall below the
   required minimum, the bank can sell some of its assets (bonds,
   mortgages, etc.) to the central bank, and in exchange, obtain the
   needed *bank reserves*.

So, on closer inspection, one realizes that what looks like a single
physical (paper) currency, in reality, is a tree of digital currencies
held together by currency pegs:

The above tree of currency pegs shows only issuers of digital
currencies that are regulated by the banking law. But again, the
“pegging business” does not stop here!

Every non-banking institution that issues
[IOUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU), which can be traded on some
market, in reality, issues a currency (digital or not). Most of these
non-banking currencies are also pegged to the national currency.

[Bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)) are the most
obvious example. Bonds can be issued by governments, municipalities,
or corporations. They are traded on specialized markets, where most of
the buyers and sellers are banks, or other big financial
institutions. Every bond has a [face
value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_value), which is a fixed
exchange rate to the national currency, declared by the issuer of the
bond. In theory, the amount that bond issuers can issue is
unlimited. In practice, the amount is limited by the availability of
bond buyers.

Now, getting back to the original question:

<div class="message">
  Isn't allowing everybody to create and issue their own currency a
  terrible idea?
</div>

I honestly do not know! But what I know is that lots of big, and not
so big players, have been doing this for hundreds for years, and the
"game" is much less regulated than commonly perceived. Occasionally,
this leads to a mess. But most of the time, it seems to work quite
well.

## Does Swaptacular allow currency pegs?

Of course, it does!
