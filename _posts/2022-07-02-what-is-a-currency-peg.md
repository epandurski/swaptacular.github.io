Allowing everybody to create and issue their own currency is a
terrible idea, right? Wouldn't this turn into a complete mess?

Well, yes, and no! Here is where currency pegging comes in:

> Currency pegging is when a country attaches, or pegs, its exchange
> rate to another currency, or basket of currencies, or another
> measure of value, such as gold. Pegging is sometimes referred to as
> a fixed exchange rate. A currency peg is primarily used to provide
> stability to a currency by attaching its value, in a predetermined
> ratio, to a different and more stable currency.

Often, governments of smaller countries peg their currencies to the
currency of a bigger country. But this "pegging business" does not
stop here.

When a new commercial bank starts to operate, in reality, a brand new
digital currency is being created. When the bank approves a loan,
fresh new tokens of the bank's digital currency are being issued in
circulation. With tens of thousands commercial banks operating, how
come this does not turn into a complete mess?

You probably know the answer to this question already: Every
commercial bank pegs its digital currency to the currency issued by
the central bank of the country. The currency issued by the central
bank is called *bank reserves*.

> Bank reserves are the cash minimums that financial institutions must
> have on hand in order to meet central bank requirements. This is
> real paper money that must be kept by the bank in a vault on-site or
> held in its account at the central bank. Cash reserves requirements
> are intended to ensure that every bank can meet any large and
> unexpected demand for withdrawals.

When somebody transfers money from one commercial bank to another, in
reality, several "invisible" exchanges happen:

1. The sender's bank "sells" some amount of its *bank reserves* to the
   central bank.

2. The central bank increases the *bank reserves* held by the
   recipient's bank, and instructs the bank to "wire" the same amount
   of recipient's bank digital currency to the recipient's account.

3. If the *bank reserves* held by the sender's bank fall below the
   required minimum, the bank can sell some of its assets (bonds,
   mortgages, etc.) to the central bank, and in exchange, obtain the
   needed *bank reserves*.

So, on closer inspection, one realizes that what looks like a single
physical (paper) currency, in reality, is a jungle of digital
currencies held together by currency pegs:
