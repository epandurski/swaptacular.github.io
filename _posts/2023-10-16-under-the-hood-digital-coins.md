In [a previous post](/2023/09/02/under-the-hood-payments-web-api/) I
outlined how Swaptacular's Payments Web API works. In this post, I will talk
about Swaptacular's *digital coins*.

Every Swaptaclar currency is uniquely identified by its *debtor ID* (a
64-bit integer number). In principal, the only thing that you need to know
in order to create an account with a given currency, is the currency's
debtor ID. In practice however, before you decide to create an account, you
will want to see more information about the currency: the name of the
currency, the currency unit, the exchange rate with other currencies, etc.

To solve this inconvenience, Swaptacular defines a reliable *decentralized*
way to obtain basic information about Swaptaclar currencies.

## Digital coins

A "digital coin" is a special kind of link, that points to a document which
describes a particular Swaptacular currency. There are three specifications
which deal with this topic:

- [The "swpt" URI Scheme](/public/docs/swpt-uri-scheme.pdf)

  This specification defines how Swaptacular currencies and Swaptacular
  accounts can be represented by [Uniform Resource Identifiers
  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (URI).
  
  For example, the URI `swpt:1234` represents the Swaptacular currency with
  debtor ID 1234; and the URI `swpt:1234/example-account` represents some
  random account with that currency.

- [Digital Coins in Swaptacular](/public/docs/digital-coin-urls.pdf)

  This specification defines all the nitty-gritty details of how exactly
  digital coins work in Swaptacular.

  For example, the digital coin `https://example.com/foo#swpt:1234` tells
  that the document that describes the `swpt:1234` currency, can be found at
  URL `https://example.com/foo`.

  Note that the information obtained from the URL can not be considered 100%
  trustworthy, and should be verified prior to receiving payments to newly
  created accounts. By including the debtor ID directly in the digital coin
  ("1234" in the example above), the verification can be performed
  automatically, without requiring any actions from the user.

- [CoinInfo JSON Documents](/public/docs/coin-info-documents.pdf)

  This specification defines one of the standard document formats
  ([JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-based) that can be used for
  describing Swaptacular currencies. Note that, if need be, other document
  formats may also be standardized in the future.

  For example, the following file:
  
        {
          "type": "CoinInfo",
          "debtorName": "Example Currency",
          "summary": "This is an example currency.\n",
          "debtorHomepage": {
            "uri": "https://www.example-currency.com/"
          },
          "amountDivisor": 100,
          "decimalPlaces": 2,
          "unit": "USD",
          "peg": {
            "type": "Peg",
            "exchangeRate": 1,
            "debtorIdentity": {
              "type": "DebtorIdentity",
              "uri": "swpt:666"
            },
            "latestDebtorInfo": {
              "uri": "https://www.usa.gov/USD"
            },
            "display": {
              "type": "PegDisplay",
              "amountDivisor": 100,
              "decimalPlaces": 2,
              "unit": "USD"
            }
          },
          "debtorIdentity": {
            "type": "DebtorIdentity",
            "uri": "swpt:1234"
          },
          "latestDebtorInfo": {
            "uri": "https://example.com/foo"
          },
          "revision": 1
        }

  describes a currency named "Example Currency", which is pegged to the US
  dollar with 1-to-1 exchange ratio (the URIs and debtor IDs are made-up).

  Note the document that describes a given currency will most likely be
  hosted on servers operated by the [debtors agent node](/overview/) which
  is responsible for managing the currency. A limited number of well-known
  currencies (like the USD), will have well-known debtor IDs, and their
  descriptions will be immutable and hosted on well-known locations.
