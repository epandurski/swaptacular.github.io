In [a previous post](/2023/08/28/under-the-hood-smp/) I explained how the
Swaptacular Messaging Protocol works, demonstrating the most important use
cases.

In this post I will talk about the [server Web
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) that currency holders' client
apps use, to directly communicate with the [creditors agent
node](/overview/) which is responsible for managing their accounts.

<!--more-->

Most currency holders (aka creditors) will want to use the services of more
than one creditors agent, and because of this, the interoperability between
different currency holder client apps, and different creditors agent nodes
is very important. Swaptacular recommends every creditors agent to implement
the [Payments Web API
Specification](/public/docs/swpt_creditors/redoc.html).
