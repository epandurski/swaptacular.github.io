In [a previous post](/2023/08/28/under-the-hood-smp/) I explained how the
Swaptacular Messaging Protocol works, demonstrating the most important use
cases.

In this post I will talk about the [server Web
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) that currency holders' client
apps use, to directly communicate with the [creditors agent
node](/overview/) which is responsible for managing their accounts.

<!--more-->

Most currency holders (aka creditors) would want to use the services of more
than one creditors agent, and because of this, the interoperability between
different currency holder client apps, and different creditors agent servers
is very important. To facilitate this interoperability, Swaptacular
recommends every creditors agent to implement the [Payments Web API
Specification](/public/docs/swpt_creditors/redoc.html).

The **Payments Web API** (PWAPI for short) is a practical [RESTful
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), defined
in the terms of the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification
language. The PWAPI specification itself, contains a lot of details and
examples already, and therefore, here I will try to outline only the most
important high-level concepts, which can help the reader to navigate the
details.

**A fair warning:** This post may become too technical for the taste of some
readers.
