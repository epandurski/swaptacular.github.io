While most of Swaptacularâ€™s components have long been stable and
reliable, orchestrating them to work seamlessly together [is no easy
task](/2024/07/07/under-the-hood-running-everything-together/) â€”
especially when scalability and high availability come into play. The
challenge intensifies even further given that Swaptacular is a
financial application, with many security-critical admin tasks.

Luckily, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is designed to solve
exactly these kinds of problems!

After months of learning and tinkering with endless YAML files, I came
up with a flexible [template for deploying Swaptacular nodes to
Kubernetes clusters](https://github.com/swaptacular/swpt-k8s-config).
This template includes detailed step-by-step instructions, enabling
anyone with a good grasp of Kubernetes to deploy their own
[Swaptacular nodes](/overview/) in a production.

**Important note:** [The service responsible for automated currency
exchanges](/2024/07/04/automated-currency-exchanges/) has not yet
reached version 1.0. While major changes are unlikely, some
adjustments â€” possibly backward-incompatible ones â€” may still be
necessary.
